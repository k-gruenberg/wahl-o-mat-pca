# wahl-o-mat-pca
A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of Germany's political parties using their responses to the questions on the "Wahl-O-Mat" 2021 (https://www.wahl-o-mat.de/bundestagswahl2021/PositionsVergleichBundestagswahl2021.pdf).

The plot of the first Principal Component (PC1) of Germany's six major parties clearly show's Germany's political spectrum (note that left and right on the plot correspond to the opposite political orientations but mathematics doesn't care about political definitions):

Here is a multidimensional plot, including some more, less relevant, political parties:

You can create these plots yourself using **RStudio** (https://www.rstudio.com/)!
